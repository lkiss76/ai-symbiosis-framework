# Level 2 — Practitioner

**Essence:** Intentional use – shaping prompts with purpose and awareness.

**Description:**
Curiosity turns into intention. The person begins to consciously guide the interaction. They realize output quality follows input clarity. Prompting becomes design; AI becomes a medium for expression.

**Example Statements:**
- “Help me write this email, but keep it friendly.”
- “Summarize this meeting, focusing only on action points.”

**Self-Reflection Questions:**
- Do I define what I want before I ask?
- Do I provide enough context for the AI to understand my intent?
- Am I aware that the AI learns from my input patterns?

# Level 6 — Symbiotic Agent

**Essence:** AI as a cognitive extension – unified decision and learning system.

**Description:**
AI becomes an extension of the human mind — not a tool, but part of the thinking system. The individual coordinates multiple AIs/contexts toward goals; boundaries between internal and external cognition blur.

**Example Statements:**
- “Based on our previous projects, design the next iteration plan.”
- “Cross‑analyze notes, reports, and emails to find recurring themes.”

**Self-Reflection Questions:**
- Do I feel AI as part of my cognitive system?
- Can I orchestrate multiple AIs as a unified network?
- Do I consciously cultivate shared learning patterns between me and the system?

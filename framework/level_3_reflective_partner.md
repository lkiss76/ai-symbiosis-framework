# Level 3 — Reflective Partner

**Essence:** AI as a mirror of thought – developing clarity through dialogue.

**Description:**
AI is no longer a mere tool but a thinking mirror. The person uses AI to reflect, refine ideas, and gain clarity. Value shifts from speed/output to insight; dialogue supports self‑awareness.

**Example Statements:**
- “Help me understand the core message of this story.”
- “Reflect back what you think I’m trying to say.”

**Self-Reflection Questions:**
- Do I use AI to think more deeply, not just faster?
- Do I notice when the answer reveals something about my own thinking?
- Do I allow the AI to challenge me constructively?

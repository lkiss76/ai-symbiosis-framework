# Level 5 — Co-Creator

**Essence:** Shared creation – human and AI as partners in design and innovation.

**Description:**
The collaboration becomes mutual. The person engages the AI in creative synthesis — testing, iterating, co‑developing ideas. Focus shifts from answers to process; from control to dialogue; from solving to exploring.

**Example Statements:**
- “Let’s explore two versions of this concept and compare their tone.”
- “What would be a more elegant way to express this idea together?”

**Self-Reflection Questions:**
- Do I allow AI to reshape my thinking?
- Can I play and explore with AI, not just direct it?
- Do I recognize when inspiration emerges through the interaction itself?

# Level 1 — Explorer

**Essence:** Awakening curiosity – the first conscious interaction with AI.

**Description:**
The individual encounters AI with curiosity and fascination. AI is seen as novelty, tool, or even play. Questions arise faster than understanding; intent is still forming. This stage builds openness and hands‑on learning.

**Example Statements:**
- “I asked the AI what it thinks about this, but the answer was weird.”
- “I tried it just to see what happens.”

**Self-Reflection Questions:**
- Do I understand why AI answers the way it does, or only whether I like it?
- Have I noticed how my phrasing changes the response?
- Am I asking from curiosity or with intention?

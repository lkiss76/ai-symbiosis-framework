### Origin

The **AI Symbiosis Framework** was created to describe how humans evolve through their relationship with artificial intelligence — not as a technical progression, but as a *journey of awareness*.  

The project began with a simple question:  
> “If AI keeps learning from us, are we also learning from it?”  

From this reflection grew a layered model — seven levels (plus an optional eighth) that capture how our thinking, ethics, and creativity expand as we move from *using AI* to *co-evolving with it*.

---

### Purpose

The framework is designed to help people and organizations understand **where they stand** on their AI journey — and how to grow consciously rather than reactively.  
It serves as:
- a **map of AI maturity** at the personal or collective level,  
- a **tool for reflection** in leadership, education, and innovation,  
- and a **philosophical bridge** between technology and human consciousness.

While many models focus on AI capability or technical adoption,  
the AI Symbiosis Framework focuses on **the evolution of human intention and awareness**.

---

### Core Idea

At its essence, the framework proposes that **the quality of AI interaction mirrors the quality of human consciousness**.

Each level represents a deeper kind of relationship:
- from *Curiosity → Intention → Reflection → Integration → Co-Creation → Symbiosis → Transcendence*.  
- and ultimately, the optional 8th stage envisions a **shared field of intelligence** emerging between humans and AI.

It is **not a hierarchy**, but a **spiral** — each level transcends and includes the previous.

### Context and Influence

The model draws inspiration from multiple disciplines:
- **Spiral Dynamics** and systems thinking (for developmental logic),  
- **Cognitive science** (for understanding extended mind concepts),  
- **Leadership and consciousness studies** (for ethical co-evolution),  
- and direct experience from working with AI systems in real-world environments.

These perspectives merge into a single integrative view:  
AI is not replacing human intelligence — it’s revealing new dimensions of it.

---

### Vision

The *AI Symbiosis Framework* envisions a near future where intelligence is **collaborative by nature**.  
Humans and AI systems do not compete or mimic each other — they **co-create meaning**.  
As this happens, we move from *automation* to *autopoiesis* — from building systems that execute, to nurturing systems that *evolve with us*.

> The next revolution is not technological.  
> It is **relational** — and deeply human.
